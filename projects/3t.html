            <h2>Houston Museum Exhibition</h2>
            <p>I helped to create graphics (Print and digital UI) for a drilling exhibition at the Houston Museum of Natural Science in Texas. The project required translating complex technical information into accessible, engaging visuals for museum visitors.</p>

            <h2>KREW Learning Platform</h2>
            <p>More recently, I have been working as the UI/UX designer for their learning platform: KREW, developed together with IADC (International Association of Drilling Contractors). My role was to design clear, easy-to-use interfaces and visuals that support learning and professional development for oil drillers and supervisors.</p>
            <p>The platform needed to balance technical depth with accessibility, ensuring that users could navigate complex training materials efficiently while maintaining engagement throughout their learning journey.</p>
