            <h2>Bournemouth University Self Help Books</h2>
            <p>Two A4 64-page books and an A6 pocketbook. The student book helps students who have mental difficulties to organise their studies. The tutor's book helps employees to work with students who have learning difficulties. Later on, an additional supporting app was created. The client particularly wanted the books to be in a landscape format. The books follow the strict Bournemouth University brand guidelines and use a bright colour palette throughout.</p>
