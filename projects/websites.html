            <h2>Muvule</h2>
            <p>Muvule is a social impact initiative focused on tackling poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa, beginning in Uganda, by empowering individuals to launch and grow small, local businesses through accessible micro-loans. For this project,</p>

            <h2>Urban Warriors (UW)</h2>
            <p>UW is a mixed martial arts gym based in central London. Their previous website suffered from an outdated visual style, technical issues, and poor mobile responsiveness, and it lacked key functionality needed to support the business.</p>        </div>

            <h2>Dorset Cottage Holidays</h2>
            <p>Dorset Cottage Holidays is a family-owned business offering holiday cottage rentals across Dorset. Their previous website was outdated, slow, and not optimised for mobile devices, making it difficult for users to browse and book properties.</p>
            <p>The project focused on migrating all existing content to WordPress, redesigning the layout, and creating a visually consistent, easy-to-use interface. I worked closely with a separate development team to design a custom search and booking plugin, and later took part in implementing and refining it so it could be easily managed by the business owner.</p>        </div>
