            Over the years, I have worked on a range of digital and print projects with the NHS in Dorset. Collaborating closely with their marketing team, I helped develop concepts and prototypes for apps, explainer videos, printed materials, and websites.

            <p>New Natives is a platform that helps foreign nationals to understand and access the NHS healthcare system. The app was built together as a prototype but later evolved into a website directory. It assists foreigners to understand the NHS system in their native languages. The app and the website use simple hierarchy patterns and implement the NHS brand guidelines all through.</p>
